Space Invaders Game

My own take on the world-wide known arcade space invaders game. Part of an assignment for the University of Essex. 
Game built in Java using Android Studio. 
Main functionalities:
Moving, shooting, pause, menu, scoreboard connected to a database, different levels getting more difficult, different dialogues. 

In order to run the game you only need to download the APK to your device/emulator.

Either download it from Github going into app/build/outputs/apk/debug or use the link:
